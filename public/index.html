    <h1>The spectacle before us was indeed sublime.</h1>
    <p>Apparently we had reached a great height in the atmosphere, 
      for the sky was a dead black, and the stars had ceased to twinkle. </br>
      By the same illusion which lifts the horizon of the sea to the level of the spectator 
      on a hillside, the sable cloud beneath was dished out, and the car seemed to float in the 
      middle of an immense dark sphere, whose upper half was strewn with silver. </br>
      Looking down into the dark gulf below, I could see a ruddy light streaming 
      through a rift in the clouds.
